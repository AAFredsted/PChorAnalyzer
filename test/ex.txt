Test description for .//buyerSellerTest/:
------------------------------
Protocol
-------
buyerseller.cor provides a verbose buyerseller protocol, where two buyers coordinate to purchase an item from a seller.
Test shows that Pchor can work with included .hpp files.

Cases
------

correct_test: Seller::InitiateSale, Buyer1::sale1 and Buyer2::sale2 are validated
incorrect_receive: Buyer2 receives partialquote over wrong channel from Buyer1 and Buyer2 receives quote over wrong channel from Seller. Buyer1:sale1 is validated.

Protocol
-------
These testcases assess how differnt choreographic descriptions can validate the same c++ code.
ring.cpp contains a simple rinbarrier api, where the amount of participants can be decided at runtime.

Cases
------

finite: the code is validated for 10 participants and Process::sendThenReceive and Process::receiveThenSend are validated
nested: tests that Pchor can nest global types within other global types. Process::sendThenReceive and Process::receiveThenSend are validated.
outofbounds: tests that Pchor can validate for unbounded foreach expressions where n is runtime dependant.
