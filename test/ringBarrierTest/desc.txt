Protocol
-------
These testcases assess how differnt choreographic descriptions can validate the same c++ code.
ring.cpp contains a simple rinbarrier api, where the amount of participants can be decided at runtime.

Cases
------

finite: the code is validated for 10 participants and Process::sendThenReceive and Process::receiveThenSend are validated
nested: tests that Pchor can nest global types within other global types. Process::sendThenReceive and Process::receiveThenSend are validated.
outofbounds: tests that Pchor can validate for unbounded foreach expressions where n is runtime dependant.
